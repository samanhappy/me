description: A brief introduction to what Agent Skills are and how to design them.
---

## Definition

In short, Agent Skills are just a set of skill directories. Each skill directory contains a group of files:
- SKILL.md: the core definition
- referenced instructions
- executable code

These files provide extra instruction context and deterministic code capabilities for the agent.

## Design principle

Progressive loading is the core design principle of Agent Skills.

## Comparison

Compared with MCP, Skills are simpler — they are just files.
